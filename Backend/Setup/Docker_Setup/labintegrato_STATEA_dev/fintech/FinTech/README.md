# Prediction and send data

The fintech part in this project is divided into two parts:

- [Prediction](Predizone/README.md)

- [Restful api](Flask/README.md)

In this project we created a Restful api to handle predictions generated with scripts in python using Scikit-learn which is an open-source library for machine learning in Python.

Our task was to pass our predictions to the Backend which would subsequently pass them to the Frontend

For more infomation see the individual parts mentioned above

This is a [requirements](requirements.txt) for run this project requirements
